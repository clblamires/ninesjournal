       Namika is a scholar at heart, constantly buried in scrolls and books. She has been wanting to study Sheikah history above all other subjects, but finds herself unable to advance her knowledge in Hyrule because most relics have already been unearthed and studied. She hears rumors that Calatia may have been visited by ancient Sheikah and may have other relics or treasures to encounter. Though she is a scholar, she is proficient in her long bow and is very capable of defending herself and those around her from any threat.
