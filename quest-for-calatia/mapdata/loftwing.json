    "description" : "The Loftwing Province is named after the great loftwing birds that roost in the southern mountains at Skygarden. It is generally considered one of the most impoverished provinces in Calatia. Over a thousand years ago, this area was the capital of Calatia. During the Rush, this southern area was entirely abandoned and its cities fell to ruin. After the Great Disaster, new villages were founded on the ruins.",
