            A ranger from the High Forest, Myrtle is a very strong and capable warrior. She joins up with Ickim after rescuing him from an angry mob who assumed he was going to steal something. She watches over her younger companion and helps guide their group through the wilderness with her expertise in tracking and nature.<br>

        <h2>Ickim the Great</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Race</b>: Kobold</li>
            <li><b>Class</b>: Fighter 3</li>
            <li><b>Archtype</b>: Echo Knight</li>
            <li><b>Equipment</b>: Scimitars, Crossbow, Sword of the Goddess's Wrath</li>
            <li><b>Animal Companion</b>: Mouse the mouse</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ickim is a fighter at heart. He's not overly intelligent and relishes in combat. He is able to conjure a dark shadow of himself (called Mikci) that can take hits for him and help him in a fight. He uses it to protect his friend Myrtle, summoning Mikci to block attacks and putting himself in the front of a fight. He has a great love for cheese.<br>
