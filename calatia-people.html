    <dt id="miko">Captain Miko</dt>
    <dd>
        Miko is the captain of the merchant ship Nayru's Blessing. It makes frequent trips between Hyrule and Calatia, at least three or more trips per year. Miko is an old, bumbling hylian that dresses nicely and loves food. He is often very jovial and is rarely very serious. When his ship was attacked by the Masked Assailants, he was mortally wounded. He sent the remainder of his crew away while sacrificing himself to destroy his ship and as many enemies as he could. Sadly, the enemies all teleported away right as his bomb exploded and his sacrifice was in vain.

    <dt id="zima">Zima</dt>
    <dd>
        A mercenary Rito in charge of the night crew on Nayru's Blessing. She is very cold to all of her subordinates and speaks rarely to her employer. She mostly stayed up in the crow's nest of the ship, seldom speaking to anyone at all. She was last seen by the day crew as she took her shift, saying "Good night" to them as she took her post. She is presumed dead.

    <dt id="beedle">Beedle</dt>
    <dd>    
        Beedle is a traveling merchant from Hyrule. He carries an uncommonly large bag full of many different kinds of trickets, artifacts, and knick-knacks. He was hired by Miko because he owned a crossbow, though it seems unlikely that he has ever really used it. In battle, Beedle frequently gets in the way and fumbled with his weapons. He escaped Nayru's Blessing with Zedeki and his crew. In the fight at the Southern Lighthouse, Ophinia tells him to remain behind while the rest of them deal with the Bokoblins.

    <dt id="masked-assailants">Masked Assailants</dt>
    <dd>
        These mysterious enemies attacked Nayru's Blessing when it came in range of Calatia. Most of them were armed with crossbows and maces, but a few of them were spellcasters. They are able to suddenly vanish and reappear as necessary, quickly teleporting away after one of them shouted, "We got it!" as the battle on the merchant ship came to a close.
    </dd>

    <dt id="tarin">Tarin</dt>
    <dd>
        The caretaker of the Southern Lighthouse. Tarin is an extremely old man, usually seen walking with a cane. He and his wife took up the mantle of caretakers when they were very young. After his wife passed away, Tarin continued as caretaker alone. His task is simple and unceremonial: keep the light stone in the pedestal. For all of his years, he succeeded at this. On a dark night, large spiders quietly covered the lighthouse and a strange demon led Bokoblins to overrun the lighthouse. He locked himself in the caretaker's house as long as he could, but the lighthouse fell. Zedeki and the mercenaries saved him before anything further could happen to him, and the lighthouse was lit again.
