<p>
    I honestly don't know what we're doing in this world right now. What is our purpose? What is my purpose? I suppose it doesn't matter as long as we are alive. This is a list of our current tasks and the things we need to do to make them happen, as far as we understand it.

        <p class="quest-description">
            The farmer is missing and may have been taken by whatever giant creature ran through the farm. We offered to help Hebo find and rescue his friend. The farmer is safe now, and we'll escort him back into town.

        <h3>Find the monster that destroyed Hebo's Farm</h3>
        <p>
            Something attacked Hebo's farm, and Exatorus wants us to find it. He prefers that we bring it back to him alive, but that might not be possible. We found it underneath the plains surrounded by Kraul.

        <h3>Capture the monster that destroyed Hebo's Farm</h3>
        <p>
            Exatorus wanted it alive. We couldn't guarantee it would survive if we found it. And it didn't. I ended up overkilling it by blowing its head off. We scavanged its legs to provide the wizard with a sample, but the rest of the body of the drow spider will rot in the tunnels below the sun.

        <h3>Bring the farm monster to Exatorus</h3>
        <p>
            Exatorus wanted a sample of the monster or monsters that attacked Hebo's farm. As it turned out, these were phase spiders. Oromis, being the brute that he is, lifted and hauled the spider's dead body to Exatorus himself.
