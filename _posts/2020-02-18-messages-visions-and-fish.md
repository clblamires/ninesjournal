Morning came to the travelers eventually, and each of them quickly helped Colapius start the campfire. The ground was cold but not yet frosted, and they heard nothing around them but the sound of the nearby stream. Colapius began making a stew for breakfast while each of the sentinels set about to get ready for the travel to Kanalet. Ophinia tended to her horse. Gongu and Whisper went to patrol around the camp. Nami used her Lens of Truth to magically identify the golden beetle recovered from Glikzong’s well: a magical hook beetle that could be remotely controlled by her.

Zedeki was gathering his equipment and preparing to take into the sky and search around the camp when he heard a strange squeaking sound coming from the stream. It said, clear as any language, “He watches you! He is amazed!”

Confused, Zedeki walked towards the stream. He saw nothing but fish in the water, all seemingly gathered as close to him as he could. “You’re great!” said a new voice. And another, “The great fish sees all!”

Gongu and Whisper had finished their reconnaissance and had come back to camp, and Ophinia came to the stream to collect some water. “Do either of you hear that voice?” asked Zedeki. They each shook their heads. The voices continued to chatter, all saying similar things. Zedeki stared at the water and the school of fish stared back.

“Are you hearing voices?” asked Ophinia. She uttered a short prayer to Hylia and was soon able to speak with animals, hearing My Lady hum to herself as she chewed her feed. But the fish did not speak to Ophinia. Instead, they continued to chatter to Zedeki. “The Wind Fish calls you!”

Colapius scoffed. “Rito,” he said, under his breath. But Zedeki heard it and, offended, took off into the sky. The fish jumped in the water as he left.

“What do you mean?” asked Nami, still focusing intently on the hook beetle.

“Never met a Rito I liked,” said Colapius. Each of the sentinels gave Colapius a funny look, so he continued. “There are only really two groups of Rito in Calatia. The Rito in Skygarden are full of themselves. Very awful people, really. Looking down at everyone because they can fly and we can’t. The other group is the Rito in the Outlands. They’re slavers. And their slaves are usually Gorons.”

This was startling to the sentinels. Slavery had been abolished in Calatia generations ago, but it was still present in the Outlands of Calatia.

Colapius and the sentinels finished their breakfast, broke down their camp, and headed north. Colapius said that he would guide them for two days until they reached Kanalet before he went back on his patrols around the Lellow Prairie. He did not stay for long, however. A harvester, one of the Scarecrow’s soldiers, approached and told him that no one had checked in on the Filmore farm in a few weeks. Colapius instead gave directions to Gongu on how to find the right paths to the town and set off to check on the farm. The sentinels were alone again, and they continued to trek north, following the small trail through the chilly hills of the Lellow Prairie.

They came to a halt at the top of a small crest that gave them a good view of the landscape around them. As the sun went down, the sentinels gathered together and surrounded themselves with bonfires. Colapius had warned them that the shadow beasts were drawn to the light, but they were afraid of fire and would not likely attack them if they stayed within the light. Gongu took the first watch while the others slept.

The night was quieter than he expected. He strode between the bonfires, keeping them lit, watching everything around their camp. At length, he noticed a shooting star. The third in two nights! This one was white in color and it briefly illuminated the ground around him.

“Pretty aren’t they?” said a feminine voice.

Gongu turned around and, sat by the central fire, was a tall woman with flowing green and brown hair. She was adorned with a long green and silver dress and had no shoes on her feet. Despite the cold in the air, she seemed perfectly pleasant as she was, smiling brightly to Gongu.

“Who are you?” he asked at length, noticing that he was staring.

“I’m Farore,” she replied. “One of the three Golden Goddesses as the people of this world call me.” When Gongu didn’t say anything more, she continued. “You’re a bit shy, but that’s okay. Hylia sees a lot of potential in you, choosing you for this quest here in Calatia. That bow you have, Stonebreaker. That was one of my creations. I made it for the first settlers of Calatia. They were gorons like yourself, but I changed them into the Ice Gorons and gave them the means of surviving in this chilly environment.

“Stonebreaker belongs to you now. I wrote your name upon it when Old Koragath could not use it any longer. It has a portion of my power flowing through it, and I am glad to give this power to you as you work to fulfill the task that Hylia set for you.”

“Thank you,” stammered Gongu. “I’m not sure what that task means or what all I have to do.”

“Hylia’s quest for Calatia is complicated, but I’m sure you and your companions will figure it out,” replied Farore. “But for now, know this: Stonebreaker will grant you great power. You can accomplish whatever it is that you will need to do so long as you adhere to this simple rule: be brave and courageous.”

“Brave and courageous.”

“Yes, for that is the essence of my Triforce. My power serves those that are courageous. If you follow that rule, you’ll be granted a lot more power than a heavy bow.”

Gongu paused. “More power? What do you mean?”

Farore smiled. “I’ll give you a free taste of that. Look up!”

Gongu turned his gaze to the stars and saw yet another shooting star cross the sky. But this one’s angle was different. It impacted the ground a few miles west of the camp. Despite the loud thud it made on landing, Gongu’s companions did not stir.

“Here’s a test of your courage,” said Farore, pointing to the landing site. “You’ll find a powerful blessing where that star landed. But you must go alone to recover it. Take your Anima if you wish. Be brave and trust in me. I will watch the camp for you.”

Gongu gave Whisper a quick pat on the head and left the safety of the ring of bonfires. He turned back occasionally to see Farore again but she had vanished. He and Whisper snuck through the cold fields for almost an hour before he came to the landing site. A glowing orb of white energy was nestled snugly into the roots of a tree. Reaching out, Gongu took up the orb. It dissolved into a wolf totem covered in shimmering light. The thought came to Gongu immediately that this was another Anima totem. He hastily fastened it to Whisper and returned to camp. The only trouble that came upon him was a solo shadow beast, but Gongu and Whisper made quick work of it.

While he slept, Zedeki dreamed of the fish in the stream. They chanted to him “The Wind Fish! Zedeki! The Wind Fish calls you!”

He woke with a start. Looking around, he spotted no other fish, no streams. His companions noticed his agitation. Ophinia and Nami tried to speak to him, but Zedeki refused to listen, thinking himself crazy for hearing voices and now dreaming of them.

Gongu made a jest at him about talking to fish, and a fire flashed in Zedeki’s eyes. He spun and fired an arcane arrow at Gongu, stabbing him in the shoulder and causing him to temporarily vanish in magical darkness. The fire went out of his eyes and was filled with a fast and deep remorse. “I’m... Gongu, I’m...”

Ophinia sprung off her horse and drew her axe. “What is this?!” she shouted. “What have you done? Your own ally?”

Gongu reappeared moments later, confused and injured. Zedeki stumbled backwards and drew from his pouch a pair of heart potions. He set them on the ground and took off into the air, away from his companions and away from any nearby water. Up high in the air, he felt acutely aware of how clear the streams in the Lellow Prairie appeared to be. He could see no fish, but was ill at ease the rest of the day. Ophinia and Nami bandaged up Gongu’s wound and fed him the potions until the ache in his shoulder disappeared.

The sentinels set forth again, found the road, and turned east towards Kanalet. Those on the ground did not speak up to Zedeki. The rito hung in the air above them, watching them and the road around. They soon came upon a path leading slightly to the north that led to an ancient battlefield. A nearby stone sign said, “The Battleground of Kanalet. Warriors of Acton bravely fought to keep our farms safe from the Great Leviathan. Honor to the dead. Honor to the Caretaker.” Nami and Ophinia began to inspect a series of standing stones nearby. Nami noticed that they seemed to react to her touch, but Ophinia felt nothing in them.

Zedeki landed near Gongu. “Gongu, I’m sorry I-”

Gongu cut him off. “It’s fine, Zedeki,” he said. “It was a joke. You were upset. We’re fine.”

“But-”

“It’s alright, really,” said Gongu. “I am okay. We are okay. I didn’t mean any disrespect.”

They shook hands and returned to the group. Nami mentioned that the standing stones reacted to her presence somehow, but the sun would be setting very soon. Zedeki pointed out that Kanalet was only a few hours away. If they hurried, they would make it before sunset.

Kanalet was a larger town than Mabel Village. It was set slightly into the Porre Mountains. Most of the buildings here were thatched-roof cottages and smaller wooden structures, except for the very large and elaborate cathedral in the center of the town – the Temple of the Caretaker. The gate attendant permitted their entry and they made their way towards the Sentinel House.

The Sentinel House was a very drab and dusty home. Almost everything in it was caked in dust and cobwebs. Plates and forks were stacked in strange places. Books lay piled all over everything. Amid the chaos of filth was a gerudo woman in white and black clothes, stewing a pot of food over the fireplace and sweeping with an old and worn-out broom.

“*Sav’saaba*!” she said as they entered.

She was Soveliss, a cleric of the god of earth and harvest, Midora. She had recently come down to the Loftwing Province on an errand and had stopped in Kanalet for far too long to clean the Sentinel House. “Sentinels don’t come to this province very often,” she explained while wiping a small statue of the Caretaker with a rag. “I think this place hasn’t been visited in nearly a year or two.”

Zedeki asked her what brought her to the province. “Well,” she replied. “I met a strange fellow on the road just a week or so ago. Ever seen a fairy? Normally bright and cheerful? Not this one. Said his name was Il, and his glow was strange and dark. He muttered about finding someone named Zedeki and kept talking about the Southern Lighthouse. Anyway, he mentioned that the Southern Lighthouse hasn’t seen a supply cart in far too long, so I’m taking a Paladin with me tomorrow and we’re going to see to it.”

“A Paladin?” asked Ophinia.

“Yes, a young boy named…. Rowan, I think. He’s at the Temple right now, but at first light he will journey with me to the south. We’ll see about the Lighthouse.”

Ophinia excused herself and left, heading straight for the temple.

“You mentioned that Il was looking for Zedeki,” said Zedeki. “That’s... that’s me.”

“*Sav*!” said Soveliss. “He wasn’t sure you were alive. If you go looking for him, go north. I met him near the Asiria Passage.”

The sentinels continued to clean the Sentinel House while Soveliss provided them with some food. While this happened, Ophinia came to the Temple of the Caretaker and went inside. She found a very old Hylian man named Var Magnus, the priest of the temple. Magnus called in Rowan, a fifteen year old Paladin boy to speak to Ophinia.

Ophinia quizzed the boy on his Paladin duties, to which he responded that he was excited and nervous to take up an oath to the Caretaker. His journey would take him to the temple at Oldtown and back up to Chorus, his hometown. Soveliss would be his guide as he traveled. Ophinia asked if he had heard the voice of the Caretaker speak to him, but Rowan told her no. “It’s… more of a feeling that I get,” he explained. “I think after I take my oath, it’ll make more sense. But I feel good whenever I pray and am in the presence of the clerics and priests.”

“Very good!” said Ophinia, though she was despondent about his response. “But here’s a tough question for you. What if another god speaks to you or gives you these good feelings? Midora, or Paraba, or someone else?”

Rowan thought about it for a moment. “I guess that would be fine, then,” he said. “The church teaches that they all work together. I don’t think it would be bad to respect many gods, especially if you do what is right for all of them.”

Pleased, Ophinia dismissed Rowan to return to his work and preparations. She asked the same question to Var Magnus. “I feel that the boy is right,” replied the Var. “The Ice Gorons, for example, pray to each of the three Golden Goddesses, and they’ve all been greatly blessed. I used to be a Paladin to the Caretaker years ago, but I’ve spoken with other spirits on many occasions. The gods are here to be respected, but they are respectful, too. Of ourselves and each other. The faithful can serve many, and can serve each of them very well.”

Ophinia nodded and excused herself. She returned to the Sentinel House. Soveliss took her leave for the night and the sentinels talked amongst themselves. They pondered where they should go. Il had the key to the Southern Lighthouse, and they needed it. They knew vaguely where he was. But should they go immediately? The Lellow Prairie was plagued with shadow beasts. How long would it take to track down Il, errant and unfaithful as he was.

“I think I can find out,” said Nami. She took up the Mask of Truth and went into a bedroom. Kneeling down, she placed the mask on her face and began chanting in Sheikah. She asked the question: “Where is Il?”

The sound of the fireplace in the parlor stopped. The sound of people outside the Sentinel house was silenced. Nami stood and looked around. The whole world seemed to have frozen in place. She stepped out into the parlor and saw her companions suspended in their conversation. But near the fireplace was a tall woman dressed in blue, stoking the fire with a long poker.

“Who are you?” asked Nami.

The woman smirked. “Is that really the question you want to ask?”

“Oh no!” cried Nami. “I didn’t mean to- ”

The woman laughed. “It’s fine, that’s just a joke! Tell you what, I’ll give you a free answer. No mask power required. My name is Nayru. I believe you came to this country on a ship named after me.”

“The goddess of wisdom!” said Nami.

“Yes, that’s right,” said Nayru. “And I’m the creator of that mask you are using right now. I also provided the spiritual power of your weapon. And I know you, Namika Rah of the Sheikah. You came here to find ancient Sheikah ruins and relics. Good news, I am very happy to provide that information to you!

“I’ll do it in one of two ways. First, ask me through the mask. If it has power and I can answer it, I’ll provide it to you. Second, when you approach anything created by the Sheikah, you may feel my presence and guidance. The ruins you came upon today at the battlefield are an example of this. There’s nothing special about those ruins, but they stand as a testament to my power. You will know when the secrets of the Sheikah can be unlocked.”

“That’s amazing, thank you!” said Nami.

“Now, as to your question. You want to find the fallen fairy, Il, correct?”

“Yes, please.”

“I have good news and bad news,” said Nayru, the smile fading slightly from her face. “The bad news is that he has been taken prisoner by Brynn the Pirate. The pirates are nasty invididuals, and they’ve barricaded themselves in an old Sheikah fortress that is today called the House of Pirates. He has been there for a few days now, and will be there for many more. The good news is that he is safe. At least, for now. Brynn is a collector of sorts, and sees the fairy as a prize.”

Nami blinked and, in an instant, was transported across the Lellow Prairie up towards Chorus. She passed many small houses and farms, stables and stores, until her vision came to a fortress nestled in the trees near the Gulf of Calatia.

“It’s unfortunate that he has been captured,” said Nayru. “But it is fortunate that he has... confidants that may be able to rescue him. And yes, if you’re wondering, Il still has the key to the Southern Lighthouse.”

Nami thought about this for a second. “I have a second question, actually.” Nayru nodded and smiled again. “Why... why can’t any of us hear Hylia here? I mean, I never have anyway, but Ophinia and Gongu used to speak to her, face-to-face I think. But they can’t hear her anymore. Ophinia wants to make a pact with Paraba but wanted Hylia’s guidance.”

Nayru’s face darkened. “That would be Majora,” she answered. “Majora is a horrid god that has illusions of grandeur. A very old tribe used to worship him and perform rituals in his name. The rituals continue to be performed, and it blocks much of the divine power and blessings that Calatia should be receiving. Even my own power is limited by Majora here. Hylia is blocked entirely. If Ophinia and Gongu wish to speak to Hylia again, Majora must be vanquished. Defeated. Killed, if it is possible.”

“Is it not possible?”

“You are out of questions, Namika Rah,” said Nayru, the smile returning. “The magic in the Mask of Truth is running low on energy. But you may tell Ophinia that Hylia is very pleased with her thus far. Making a pact with the god of heroes is a permitted by the goddess. She smiles on Ophinia, as she smiles on all of you."

The vision faded and Nami was back in her room. It seemed that no time had passed at all, but to Nami, it seemed like an age had gone by. She returned to her companions, informing them of Il’s predicament and Ophinia’s permission by Hylia. Upon hearing this, Ophinia broke into laughter. Her worries about Paraba and his pact were immediately put to ease. She mused about her questioning to Rowan and Var Magnus earlier, only to have a goddess answer the question on her mind.

The sentinels settled on setting out for the House of Pirates on the next day. Before she slept, Ophinia took Hero’s Honor in her hands and said a quick prayer.

“God of heroes,” she said. “I will make this pact with you.”

“Good,” came the response to her mind. “Prepare yourself, and be brave. I will speak to you when the time is right. May the goddess smile upon you.”

The warm feelings of Hylia rushed over Ophinia again, easing her into a blissful and easy sleep.
