        Small for a Goron, Gongu is an enigma amongst his brothers. He cares little for hammers and smashing weapons, preferring his long bow. Gongu spent much of his childhood roaming and adventuring on his own. He spends much of his time with his wolf companion, <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/whisper">Whisper</a>, a strange beast that never seems to make any noise. Gongu has learned the ability to speak with his companion. They travel to Calatia to "find meaning", guided by the voice of the Goddess Hylia. Not surprising for a Goron, Gongu cannot swim and has a fear of water.

<h2>Biography</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Sailing to Calatia</dt>
    <dd>
        Gongu and Whisper had been traveling away from Eldin and Goron City, and came to Malin Harbor. <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/il">Il</a> spotted him from afar, having been told to find strong warriors to protect the merchant ship Nayru's Blessing. <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/zedeki">Zedeki</a> spoke with Gongu and offered him a job as a mercenary on the ship, though Il accidentally let slip the highest price that <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#miko">Captain Miko</a> could afford. Gongu subsequently met with Miko and signed the contract, joining Zekedi's day crew. Off the southern coast of Calatia, the ship was attacked. Gongu helped hold off the <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#masked-assailants">attackers</a> as best as he could, though he could see his companion, <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/whisper">Whisper</a>, take blow after blow. Gongu and his companions quickly abandoned the ship at Miko's behest as the ship was clearly lost.

    <dt>The Southern Lighthouse</dt>
    <dd>
        Gongu exhausted himself helping row his companions to shore. There, he joined in a quick skirmish at <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-lore#lighthouses">The Southern Lighthouse</a> to save the caretaker, <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#tarin">Tarin</a>. Gongu quickly learned to be more careful in his attacks after being struck by a few arrows. He later helped Tarin remove the Bokoblin bodies.
