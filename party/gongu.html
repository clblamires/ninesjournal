    Small for a Goron, Gongu is an enigma amongst his brothers. He cares little for hammers and smashing weapons, preferring his long bow. Gongu spent much of his childhood roaming and adventuring on his own. He spends much of his time with his wolf companion, <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/whisper">Whisper</a>, a strange beast that never seems to make any noise. Gongu has learned the ability to speak with his companion, a gift from the goddess Hylia. They travel to Calatia to "find meaning." Not surprising for a Goron, Gongu cannot swim and has a fear of water.

<h2>Calatia</h2>
<p>
    Gongu has chosen to stay with the rest of the mercenaries and form a traveling party. This provides him and Whisper some protection from the masked people who seek to silence them. Gongu has also learned that the Ice Gorons of the far north used to keep wolf companions like he does, and created special totems to give them power.
