    A Paladin in the service of the church of Hylia, Ophinia is a strong but guarded individual. She largely keeps to herself and finds it difficult to trust new people. Her most trusted companion, however, is gone. Hylia herself speaks to Ophinia and informs her that her companion may return to her if she can find a certain spirit, rumored to be somewhere in Calatia. And thus she embarks on a journey to the far north, not knowing what awaits in its frigid lands.
