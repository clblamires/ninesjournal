<p>
    Petra is the magical cannon of our group. Her magic comes from some draconic ancestry that appears as dark scales on half of her face. In combat, she is fierce and full of rage. She can weave powerful spells of fire, ice, or poison and leave her enemies in ruins. Most would see her small form as insignificant, then fall prey to her magic. 
</p>
<p>
    Outside of combat, she is pleasant and delightful. She loves a good drink and is almost constantly in a cheerful mood, even causing Ezio to occasionally smile. She is subject to her own whims and desires and is somewhat chaotic. She often volunteers to join Hebo in his nightly performances at local taverns, inns, and teahouses.
