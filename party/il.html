        Most fairies produce a soft white or pink glow. Il, unfortunately, emits a darkish purple glow that gets stronger or weaker depending on his mood. Il suffers from depression for some reason and is almost constantly bringing down the mood of everyone around him. He was bound by duty to Captain Miko of Nayru's Blessing, but very clearly does not enjoy his service. He often annoys his comrades, such that <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/zedeki">Zedeki</a> occasionally banishes him when provoked too far. Despite this, the blessings of the Queen of the Fairies is upon him. When he casts his spells, his glow becomes bright white.

<h2>Biography</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Sailing to Calatia</dt>
    <dd>
        Il worked on Nayru's Blessing with Zedeki and <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#miko">Captain Miko</a>, and was tasked to find more mercenaries to protect the ship on the water. Il helped Zedeki find <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/gongu">Gongu</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/whisper">Whisper</a> before annoying Zedeki enough to cause the Rito to temporarily banish him. Il later is assigned to Zedeki's day crew on the ship. On the night of the attack, Il was protecting Miko as well as he could, but the ship was quickly overrun by <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#masked-assailants">enemies</a>. After a blast of fire knocked Il down, he helplessly watched Zedeki, Gongu, Whisper, <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/ophinia">Ophinia</a>, and <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/namika">Namika</a> escape with the lifeboat. Il tried to join them, but Miko blew up the ship with a bomb in a last-ditch effort to take out the attackers.

    <dt>The Southern Lighthouse</dt>
    <dd>
        In the aftermath of the battle on the ship, Il met up again with Zedeki and the mercenaries, and joined them as they rowed to shore. On the next day, Il reluctantly followed them to <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-lore#lighthouses">The Southern Lighthouse</a>. There, he helped heal Gongu and used his magic to help win the fight against the invading Bokoblins. Unfortunately, Il spent the rest of the day moping while the others helped <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#tarin">Tarin</a>, the lighthouse's caretaker, clean up and relight the lighthouse.
