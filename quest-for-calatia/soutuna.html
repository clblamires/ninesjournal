<h3>Soutuna Province</h3>
<p>
    This province is the most remote of all of Calatia's provinces. Only one major city exists here, and a small handful of small homesteads and farms dot the landscape. Nevertheless, this area is heavily guarded by Calatian Marshals and soldiers.

<h4>Towns and Areas</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Soutuna</b>: The only major city in the Soutuna Province. This city acts as a secondary major seaport into Calatia as it can cut a few days off the travel time of incoming merchant ships. The walled city is home to a large assortment of people, all protected by a great force of the Calatian military.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Hanyu Mountains</b>: These lofty mountains are extremely tall and almost always capped in snow.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Hanyu Forest</b>: This forest separates the Soutuna Province from the rest of Calatia. Few people travel through it, apart from the soldiers traveling to and from Soutuna. As such, the paths through the forest are worn and often hard to find.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Dragontooth Heights</b>: A series of highlands on the coast of the Gulf of Calatia. Legends say that the ancient dragons and gods were buried here during the Great Disaster. To date, no such burial grounds have ever been discovered.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Dragontooth Woods</b>: These woods are quiet and unmoving. Despite this, the Calatian military is constantly on the lookout towards the woods for reasons unknown to the citizens of the province. Very few people come near the woods.
