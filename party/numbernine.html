<p>
    I am Number Nine. I have no other name because no other name was ever given to me. I am Warforged, a soul created by powerful magic and encased in a body of metal instead of flesh and wire insted of sinew. My creators built me to conquer, but I have not heard command from them as long as I can remember. My first fully intact memory is waking in a ruined castle surrounded by the dead. I cannot recall how I got there, or what I was doing. I did not recognize any of the bodies. No living soul could be found for miles.
</p>
<p>
    Long have I sought purpose despite not knowing my own past. Those around me are fearful of my presense. I believe this is because I am so unlike them, being fully artificial with no real allegiance. I also believe they fear me because of the large thunder cannon I keep with me. Admittedly, I may use this to intimidate those that would impede my journey. The thunder cannon is a means to an end, whatever end that may be.
</p>
<p>
    Because I am Warforged, few people trust me or even speak to me. I have chosen to dedicate myself to discovery and knowledge, perhaps to fill the missing gaps in my memory. One mission, however, is still engraved in my mind and is as clear as daylight: Zero must be destroyed.
