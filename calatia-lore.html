<h1>Lore and Information of Calatia</h1>

<p>
    Calatia is a vast country, larger than most others in the world. It sits to the far north of Hyrule and the surrounding areas. Rumor has it that the Hero of Time was resurrected here, and that he may be born here again soon...

        The story has only recently begun, and we've seen only one province: Loftwing Province, named for the Loftwing birds that reside in its high places. Its capital is Skygarden, a city high atop the Toronbo Mountains. The city is known for its Loftwing breeders, but has a reputation for being unwelcome to newcomers.
        <br>
        Mabel Village is to the far west. It is a fishing village that borders a forest simply called The Mysterious Woods.
        <br>
        Oldtown is at the province's eastern border. It is a very poor town run by the Church of the Caretaker.

        Tarin, caretaker of the Southern Lighthouse, mentioned this region of the country to the far north. This was the original country of Calatia before some awful cataclysm laid it to waste. Few people venture to Old Calatia now, and its ruins are buried in more and more snow each year.

    <dt id="caretaker">The Caretaker</dt>
    <dd>The Hyruleans have many stories and legends of the gods that created their world. The Calatians do, too, but revere one above all others: the God of Protection, also called The Caretaker. The Caretaker is usually depicted as a tall figure  wearing thick furs and a long hood. The Church of the Caretaker is the primary religion in Calatia.</dd>

    <dt id="hylia">Hylia</dt>
    <dd>Hylia is honored as the guardian and protector of Hyrule. But in Calatia, she is largely unknown.</dd>

    <dt id="lighthouses">Lighthouses</dt>
    <dd>Large, magical lighthouses guard the borders of Calatia and are revered as holy sites to worshippers of the Caretaker. There are three lighthouses in use: The Southern Lighthouse in the Loftwing Province, the Western Lighthouse on the Western Sea, and the Eastern Lighthouse bordering the icy bay. A fourth lighthouse is rumored to be in Old Calatia, but has long since been lost to history. The legend says that the Lighthouses are meant to keep the darkness at bay, but few people understand what that means or if this is even their true purpose.</dd>

    <dt id="sheikah">Sheikah</dt>
    <dd>The Sheikah were the original surveyors and explorers in the world, and are most commonly seen in Hyrule. And yet, Sheikah-made relics and items have been spotted in Calatia. In fact, the light stone that gives power to the Southern Lighthouse has the symbol of the Sheikah engraved on it: a lidless eye with a tear of blood. What connection to the ancient Sheikah have with Calatia?</dd>
