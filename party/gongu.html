<p>
    Small for a Goron, Gongu is an enigma amongst his brothers. He cares little for hammers and smashing weapons, preferring his long bow. Gongu spent much of his childhood alone, roaming and adventuring on his own. He spends much of his time with his wolf companion, Whisper, a strange beast that never seems to make any noise. Gongu has learned the ability to speak with his companion. They travel to Calatia to "find meaning", guided by the voice of the Goddess Hylia. Though he is a small Goron, he is a Goron nonetheless. His weight and girth have given him a dreadful fear of water.
