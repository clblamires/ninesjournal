<dl>
    <dt id="il">Il</dt>
    <dd>
        Most fairies produce a soft white or pink glow. Il emits a dark purplish color that gets stronger or weaker depending on his mood. He suffers from depression and is almost always bringing down the mood of the people around him. He was bound to Captain Miko on Nayru's Blessing and often annoys his comrades. He was residing with Tarin in the Southern Lighthouse, but left after seeing something that interested him.
    </dd>


    <dt id="miko">Captain Miko</dt>
    <dd>
        Miko is the captain of the merchant ship Nayru's Blessing. It makes frequent trips between Hyrule and Calatia, at least three or more trips per year. Miko is an old, bumbling hylian that dresses nicely and loves food. He is often very jovial and is rarely very serious. When his ship was attacked by the Masked Assailants, he was mortally wounded. He sent the remainder of his crew away while sacrificing himself to destroy his ship and as many enemies as he could. Sadly, the enemies all teleported away right as his bomb exploded and his sacrifice was in vain.
    </dd>

    <dt id="zima">Zima</dt>
    <dd>
        A mercenary Rito in charge of the night crew on Nayru's Blessing. She is very cold to all of her subordinates and speaks rarely to her employer. She mostly stayed up in the crow's nest of the ship, seldom speaking to anyone at all. She was last seen by the day crew as she took her shift, saying "Good night" to them as she took her post. She is presumed dead.
    </dd>

    <dt id="beedle">Beedle</dt>
    <dd>    
        Beedle is a traveling merchant from Hyrule. He carries an uncommonly large bag full of many different kinds of trickets, artifacts, and knick-knacks. He was hired by Miko because he owned a crossbow, though it seems unlikely that he has ever really used it. In battle, Beedle frequently gets in the way and fumbled with his weapons. He escaped Nayru's Blessing with Zedeki and his crew. He later traveled on his own to Mabel Village to start his merchant business.
    </dd>

    <dt id="masked-assailants">Masked Assailants</dt>
    <dd>
        These mysterious enemies attacked Nayru's Blessing when it came in range of Calatia. Most of them were armed with crossbows and maces, but a few of them were spellcasters. They are able to suddenly vanish and reappear as necessary, quickly teleporting away after one of them shouted, "We got it!" as the battle on the merchant ship came to a close. More of these masked people have been spotted in Mabel Village. 
    </dd>

    <dt id="tarin">Tarin</dt>
    <dd>
        The caretaker of the Southern Lighthouse. Tarin is an extremely old man, usually seen walking with a cane. He and his wife took up the mantle of caretakers when they were very young. After his wife passed away, Tarin continued as caretaker alone. His task is simple and unceremonial: keep the light stone in the pedestal. For all of his years, he succeeded at this. On a dark night, large spiders quietly covered the lighthouse and a strange demon led Bokoblins to overrun the lighthouse. He locked himself in the caretaker's house as long as he could, but the lighthouse fell. Zedeki and the mercenaries saved him before anything further could happen to him, and the lighthouse was lit again.
    </dd>

    <dt id="huk">Huk</dt>
    <dd>
        Huk is a self-proclaimed "good Bokoblin" that runs the Spring of Wellness campground in the Featherwood Forest. His former tribe was particularly vicious and Huk's conscience kept him from that path. He seeks to help people as best as he can, though almost all people hate his kind. Huk's skin in purple unlike most Bokoblins, but this is an illusion. His real skin color is gold. Huk is an extremely powerful sorcerer.
    </dd>

    <dt id="ior">Ior</dt>
    <dd>
        Ior is Huk's son and is also gold-skinned. He acts as a cleaner in the Spring of Wellness and often runs errands for his father. He escorted Beedle the merchant to Mabel Village, but was captured by the Downrigger and had his left hand cut off. Despite this, he stays in good spirits and offers to take the Kokiri girl, Leera, back to the Spring. He is very fond of Zedeki and Ophinia, though he is very shy around them.
    </dd>

    <dt id="killiack">Killiack</dt>
    <dd>
        A poor fisherman's son in Mabel Village. Killiack's father died a few years ago, so Killiack does his best to take care of his mother and sister. He was recently blackmailed by the mysterious masked figures into service. His mission was to kill Zedeki, Namika, Ophinia, and Gongu. On his failure, Killiack's mother and sister would be killed. The mercenaries saved him from himself and plan to move him and his sister away from Mabel Village.
    </dd>
    <dt id="leera">Leera</dt>
    <dd>
        Leera is a Kokiri girl with bright green hair. The Kokiri should have disappeared from the world ages ago, but Leera continues to roam the cold north, moving between towns and being "adopted" by different families. He has a little magic and can use it to defend herself when necessary. She is over 4000 years old, and used to have a fairy companion that she hasn't seen in a long time. 
    </dd>
    <dt id="dax">Dax</dt>
    <dd>
        The Downrigger of Mabel Village. Dax is a tall, blue-skinned Zora barbarian fighter with a large sword covered in shark teeth. In his position, he acts as an intimidator to suspicious pepople who pass through the village, and shifts his skin to bright red when in a rage. He interrogates the mercenaries based on his suspicion of them colluding with Bokoblins but later comes to trust them. 
    </dd>
    <dt id="ulrira">Ulrira</dt>
    <dd>
        The Elder of Mabel Village. He usually sits quietly to himself in the Little Fish Inn each night, drinking quietly and checking his notebooks. Despite the town being impoverished, he wears an expensive jacket and boots. Most people in town greatly dislike him as they feel he is ruining the town, but in what ways is currently unknown to the party. 
    </dd>
    <dt id="acheman">Acheman</dt>
    <dd>
        An unknown demonic entity who was apparently responsible for snuffing out the light at the Southern Lighthouse. Tarin described it as a strange demon with wings, and Huk identified that description as an Acheman. Dax suggested that Acheman are extremely dangerous, and that one killed his wife over fifty years ago. The whereabouts of the Acheman from the Lighthouse are currently unknown.
    </dd>

    <dt id="not-caretaker">Not the Caretaker</dt>
    <dd>
        A mysterious voice spoke to Ophinia while she tried to pray to Hylia. It claimed to be the Caretaker, but its presense left Ophinia with a discomforting feeling. Later, it sent a specter to attack her, warning her to beware. Ophinia surmised that this is definitely not the Caretaker, but is impersonating him.
