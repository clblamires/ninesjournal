    We do not know much about Luna. I suspect Luna does not know much about Luna. She is a powerful spell-weaver and talented in close combat, but her happy-go-lucky attitude leaves me wondering: Who does she serve? What is she hiding? What is the source of that constant ringing noise she summons that causes her enemies to cringe and die?

<p>
    That said, I personally am not afraid of her. She has been nothing but outwardly friendly to the party. And what should I fear? She agrees to everything Hebo and Petra tell her. None of us (Luna included) know why she was in these parts of the world right now. She follows her heart.  I am at peace with her as a comrade, but I do not understand her.

    I guess I should feel some connection with her since she saved me from the Kraul during an unfortunate encounter. She teleported me away from my attacker and gave me an opening to remove its limbs from its body. Luna uses a trident that changes color according to her current emotion, but she does not use this to explain her emotions at any time. In fact, her trident may change color and she will not know the emotion she feels. Luna is also capable of curse magic, which I believe is that bell sound we all hear that makes creatures wither before her.
