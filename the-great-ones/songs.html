<h3 id="dragontail">I'll Tell You a Tale of a Big Dragon Tail</h3>
<p class="song">
    Come listen my fellows<br>
    as I tell you a tale<br>
    Of a dragon so evil,<br>
    He came straight from hell.
</p>
<p class="song">
    Renshato the foul spawn<br>
    so heartless, so cruel,<br>
    Unkind, unyielding,<br>
    He suffers no fools.
</p>
<p class="song">
    Sweeping, swooping, <br>
    terror upon the skies,<br>
    Blowing nasty poison,<br>
    Makes small goblins cry
</p>
<p class="song">
    Kobolds all worship <br>
    our enemy so savage,<br>
    We must defeat them all,<br>
    Our hearts won’t be ravaged
</p>
<p class="song">
    Underestimated we were<br>
    by horrid Renshato,<br>
    When a challenge he delivered,<br>
    to the Great Ones his foe,
</p>
<p class="song">
    A fight! A fight! <br>
    We stood ready in wait,<br>
    Renshato was to learn <br>
    why we are so great.
</p>
<p class="song">
    Ezio so cunning, <br>
    invisible in daylight<br>
    Petra so pleasant, <br>
    her spells are a sight
</p>
<p class="song">
    Oromis so strong, <br>
    his axe and wit sharp<br>
    Eclipse so gracious, <br>
    heals and fights with her heart
</p>
<p class="song">
    Luna so beautiful, <br>
    she’s loyal and true<br>
    Nine so intelligent, <br>
    learning daily anew
</p>
<p class="song">
    Hebo so small, <br>
    he seeks the best deeds<br>
    Spoink so fast, <br>
    the envy of all steeds
</p>
<p class="song">
    The battle plan cunning, <br>
    Each using their strengths<br>
    Attacking at first light<br>
    To make Renshato quake
</p>
<p class="song">
    Some fire, an arrow, <br>
    a swipe of an axe, <br>
    cannons shooting, strong spells,<br>
    fast running with dash
</p>
<p class="song">
    With a flourish and flurry<br>
    A dragon body fell from the sky<br>
    Goodbye Renshato,<br>
    It’s your turn to cry.
