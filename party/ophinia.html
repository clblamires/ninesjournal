        A Paladin in the service of the church of Hylia, Ophinia is a strong but guarded individual. She largely keeps to herself and finds it difficult to trust new people. Her most trusted companion, however, is gone. Hylia herself speaks to Ophinia and informs her that her companion may return to her if she can find the horse god Malanya, rumored to be somewhere in Calatia. And thus she embarks on a journey to the far north, not knowing what awaits in its frigid lands. Ophinia frequently prays to Hylia for guidance and assistance, channeling divine power into her weapons.

    <h2>Calatia</h2>
    <p>
        Ophinia's connection to Hylia has become somewhat strained since she sailed to Calatia. Where she used to speak with Hylia whenever possible, now she only feels the influence of the Goddess with her but cannot hear her words. Ophinia has also developed a sort of connection with a being that calls itself "the Caretaker", though she quickly surmises that this is an imposter.
