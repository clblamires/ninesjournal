<h1>Ophinia</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Race:</strong> Hylian
    <br>
    <strong>Class:</strong> Paladin
    <br>
    <strong>Weapons:</strong> Battle Axe, Javelins
</p>

<p>
    A Paladin in the service of the church of Hylia, Ophinia is a strong but guarded individual. She largely keeps to herself and finds it difficult to trust new people. Her most trusted companion, however, is gone. Hylia herself speaks to Ophinia and informs her that her companion may return to her if she can find a certain spirit, rumored to be somewhere in Calatia. And thus she embarks on a journey to the far north, not knowing what awaits in its frigid lands. Ophinia frequently prays to Hylia for guidance and assistance, channeling divine power into her weapons.

<h2>Biography</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Sailing to Calatia</dt>
    <dd>
        Ophinia arrived in Malin Harbor and was quickly met by <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/il">Il</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/zedeki">Zedeki</a>, who were searching for mercenaries to join them on Nayru's Blessing, a merchant ship headed for Calatia. She signed up with <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#miko">Captain Miko</a> and joined Zedeki's day crew. During the travels, she frequently visited Beedle, another merchant Miko had hired, and purchased some items from him. During the attack on the ship, Ophinia bravely rushed her attackers alongside <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/whisper">Whisper</a>, though she suffered various injuries in the process. Afterwards, she and the rest of the mercenaries escaped the ship as it was destroyed.

    <dt>The Southern Lighthouse</dt>
    <dd>
        Ophinia helped her companions row the lifeboat to the southern shore of Calatia. There, they rested for a time while observing that the nearby <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-lore#lighthouses">lighthouse</a> was apparently under attack. In the morning, they discovered that it had been overrun by Bokoblins. Ophinia and <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/gongu">Gongu</a> drew the fire of the Bokoblins while <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/namika">Namika</a> and Zedeki attacked from a distance. Once the last Bokoblin fell, Ophinia immediately rushed into the lighthouse and helped <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#tarin">Tarin</a>, the lighthouse's caretaker. He quickly ordered her to relight the lighthouse. Tarin informed the mercenaries of the role of the lighthouses in protecting Calatia's borders. Ophinia also learned that Tarin and many other Calatians have not heard of the goddess Hylia. The party later decided to travel with Ophinia to Mabel Village to get the Marshalls of that town to offer better protection to the lighthouse.
