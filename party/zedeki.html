    <strong>Weapons:</strong> Long Bow, Sacred Bow, Scimitars
</p>

<p>
    Zedeki is a hired mercenary, originally contracted with the merchant ship Nayru's Blessing. He is often at odds with the rest of the crew of the ship, especially the dark fairy Il and Zima, another Rito archer. Zedeki spends much of his time running simple errands for the ship. In his down time he fiddles with a Sacred Rito Bow, an inheritance given to him by his grandfather. Zedeki is a very accomplished archer, able to channel magic into his arrows. But despite this, he can never seem to land a shot with the sacred bow. The arrows always miss, and the few times they manage to hit, Zedeki suffers intense pain. Nevertheless, he is content with his work,so long as the captain is able to pay.

<h2>Biography</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Sailing to Calatia</dt>
    <dd>
        Zedeki and <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/il">Il</a> were hired help by <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#miko">Captain Miko</a> on Nayru's Blessing, a merchant ship ready to journey to Calatia. Miko instructed them to find at least four more people to join the guard for the ship. Zedeki eventually found <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/namika">Namika</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/ophinia">Ophinia</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/gongu">Gongu</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/whisper">Whisper</a>, and <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#beedle">Beedle</a>. They all were signed up to Zedeki's day crew, except for Beedle who was assigned (and subsequently reassigned) to <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#zima">Zima's</a> night crew. During the journey, the ship was attacked and Zedeki and his companions fought off the attack below deck. Sadly, the rest of the crew had all been overwhelmed above deck and Miko ordered Zedeki to abandon them and save himself. Zedeki and the others rowed away from Nayru's Blessing aboard a small lifeboat as the ship was destroyed.

    <dt>The Southern Lighthouse</dt>
    <dd>
        Zedeki spotted Il in the flotsam of the ship and recruited him to help the party. They landed on the southern shores of Calatia and rested. During the night, Zedeki spotted the light from the nearby <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-lore#lighthouses">lighthouse</a> suddenly extinguish. In the morning, the group ventured to the lighthouse and cleared out a group of Bokoblins that had tried to overrun it. Zedeki helped the others clean up the mess. He and Ophinia traveled north along the road to follow the Bokoblin tracks, noticing them heading west.
