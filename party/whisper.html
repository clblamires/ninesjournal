    Whisper is a strange creature. He is a wolf with strong jaws, long gray fur, and incredible strength. Despite this, the wolf makes absolutely no sound when it moves, breaths, eats, or tracks. This causes those around Whisper to feel very intimidated, but Whisper's companion, <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/gongu">Gongu</a>, feels safe around him. Gongu and Whisper share a powerful bond, having saved each other many times. Gongu is even able to communicate with Whisper through the use of magic, and Whisper refuses to speak to anyone else.
</p>
<p>
    As an Anima, Whisper has special powers that are linked to his companion, Gongu. Whisper can attune to certain Anima Totems to acquire new abilities or powers. If ever Whisper were to die, Gongu can revive him with a ritual.
