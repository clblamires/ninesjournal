    A simple map maker is released from his required service in the Solsu army and sets out to find work. Instead, he comes upon a plot to capture and enslave the gods. Ronixis Virrona, called 'Red' by his friends, must take upon him a pact with a god to deliver the Heart of Valtare to the mysterious land of Missuk before dark and dreadful forces overtake the land.

    Red was born in the land of Tridu, a place of lush forests and beautiful land in the northeast of the country of Solsu. He never met his human father and was taken care of by his elven mother. Throughout his life, he loved to make maps and chart the lands. This because very useful for him when he was conscripted into the Solsu Army at 20 years old. After completing his service in the Office of Cartography, Red began his journey home, looking for work to finance his travels. He still carries with him the armaments of war given to him by the army, but has learned magic thanks to his pact with the goddess Valtare. He uses it to fulfill her divine quest: deliver the Heart of Valtare to the great temple in Missuk.
