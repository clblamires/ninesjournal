<h3>The Skeletons</h3>

<div class="character">
    <h4 id="froika">Froika</h4>
    <img src="{{ site_url }}/images/adventureskeletons/froika.gif" alt="Image of Froika" class="character-image">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Ancestry</b>: Dwarf
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Costume</b>: Butcher
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In life, Froika the Dwarf was probably hefty - even for a dwarf! Despite being nothing but bones for the last hundred years, she still has the insatiable urge to eat. Food falls from her boney teeth through her ribcage, all the way down her pelvis and onto the arms. Sometimes her hunger gets the better of her and she impulsively jumps into dangerous situations without thinking, feeling gloomy if she is forced to retreat.
    </p>

<div class="character">
    <h4 id="alfred">Alfredicus</h4>
    <img src="{{ site_url }}/images/adventureskeletons/alfred.gif" alt="Image of Alfred" class="character-image">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Ancestry</b>: Elf
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Costume</b>: Red-shirted Plumber
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Probably the wisest of the skeletons, Alfredicus (Alfred, to his friends) is a skeleton who always thinks before he acts. He remembers much of his former life as a high elf scholar. Because of this, he still loves to read whenever possible, and can read and speak many languages. His brains (though he doesn't have any) often keep the skeletons out of trouble.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="character">
    <h4 id="larkin">Larkin</h4>
    <img src="{{ site_url }}/images/adventureskeletons/larkin.gif" alt="Image of Larkin" class="character-image">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Ancestry</b>: Elf
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Costume</b>: Gargoyle
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Larkin is also an elf, but not of high scholastic aptitude like Alfred. Instead, Larkin loved to go on long hunting adventures with his friends. He favored the bow back in his life, and still prefers it as an undead monster. He is a warrior at heart and an excellent shot. Rather than wear full costumes like his skeleton companions, Larkin chooses to wear masks.
    </p>

<div class="character">
    <h4 id="chrom">Chrom</h4>
    <img src="{{ site_url }}/images/adventureskeletons/chrom.gif" alt="Image of Chrom" class="character-image">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Ancestry</b>: Human
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Costume</b>: Farmer
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Chrom is a very intelligent skeleton, though he doesn't show it. Perhaps he is shy? Or maybe he's always deep in thought? Either way, Chrom provides a level head to the group when they are working. However, when it comes to battle, he's often first in line. In a fight, Chrom becomes a terror to any who dare stand up to him and his twin scimitars.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="character">
    <h4 id="matilda">Matilda</h4>
    <img src="{{ site_url }}/images/adventureskeletons/matilda.gif" alt="Image of Matilda" class="character-image">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Ancestry</b>: Goblin
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Costume</b>: Grave Digger
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Possibly the most clever and evil of the skeletons, Matila has a penchant for dismembering victims and toting their heads - but only if their hair is long enough to tie around her waist. She uses her collection of severed heads as a distraction to her enemies, allowing herself and her companions to quickly escape. She also often gets tasked with carrying the party's bag.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="character">
    <h4 id="rok">Rok Snaggletooth</h4>
    <img src="{{ site_url }}/images/adventureskeletons/rok.gif" alt="Image of Rok" class="character-image">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Ancestry</b>: Orc
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Costume</b>: Hobo
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The rest of the skeletons say that Rok is the dumbest of the skeletons, but Rok doesn't mind. He makes up for it with brute strength and with the longsword that he acquired when meeting a very unfortunate paladin. Rok speaks very slowly and clumsily, but has a ravaging thirst for blood. He wears thick leather armor and wields a metal shield, ever ready for a fight.
