We met in town, all of us. Each of us was trying to find a local wizard, Exatorus. But we found Hebo first. Ezio tried to convince us to stay away from the wizard, though we don't know why. Even Ezio doesn't remember it. But Hebo was looking for help with a problem at his farm: all of his animals were dying and perhaps Exatorus could tell him why.

Oromis, the wizard's hired muscle, led us to his master's tower outside of town. Exatorus was surprised to see our group, and I can understand why. A warforged, an elf, a druid, a goblin, and a gnome all gathered at his doorstep probably looked very strange. He didn't know what was attacking Hebo's farm, but sent his servant to accompany us and find out more. He gave us a task, requesting that we bring back the attacker alive. Ezio refused to accompany us until Exatorus spoke some strange language I didn't understand, and Ezio was suddenly a very willing companion.

Hebo led the way, and we arrived at the's farm by nightfall. I soon realized that I was the only member of this party to lack darkvision. My comrades all seemed very alert in the darkness. I was fortunate that the moonlight made things easier for me. Ezio seemed on edge, insisting that we find the attackers as soon as possible. To our deepest regret, we decided to use the remaining living animal on the farm as bait. Ezio and I hid up on a hill while the others waited to ambush the attackers.

Our ambush failed miserably and the animal was immediately killed. Phase spiders, larger than I ever knew could exist, attacked us. The thunder cannon, the great weapon of my illusioned past, failed me in the dark. But it did it's job. The loud noise distracted the spiders so that my comrades could dispatch them. Oromis and Hebo attacked one. Ezio and I were ambushed on the hill, but we defended ourselves well enough. Petra and Luna cast their spells to keep them at bay.

The fight was a victory for us, despite the loss of the animal. Hebo, using only his voice and verses of some far away song, gave Oromis unfounded strength as he impaled one spider. A spider went for Spoint, Hebo's steed. Hebo, in an apparent desparation, launched his tiny form at the attacker and stuck it in the head with his small dagger. Luna was injured by a spider, but Petra came to her aid and reduced the spider to ashes.

Only after the three spiders were dispatched that we remembered: Exatorus wanted one alive. Oromis laughed it off, knowing his master wouldn't truly send us to spare something as dangerous as a phase spider. For now, we gathered ourselves and decided to look around the farm.
