<h2>E.L.F.S. - A Holiday Adventure</h2>
<p>
    At the North Pole, Santa and his elves work tirelessly year round to provide toys and happiness for the children of the world. Each Christmas Eve, Santa rides out into the night with his sleigh, eight reindeer, and a bag full of joy.
</p>
<p>
    But he flies alone. What happens to him when something goes wrong?
</p>
<p>
    That's the job of E.L.F.S. - The Effective Liberating Flight Squad, an elite elf force trained especially for combat and liberation situations. Whenever disaster struck, E.L.F.S. was there. They don't just liberate Santa from trouble. They liberate the children of the world from a sad, sad Christmas morning if something goes awry...
