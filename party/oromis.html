    Oromis is exactly what you would expect: incredibly brave and severely strong. He is a dwarf with little to hide. He wields an axe large enough to compare to my thunder cannon. His armor is covered in spikes and hooks. His precision with a javelin is exact. Outwardly, Oromis is a fearsome creature and likely the cause of panic in town when on a job for Exatorus.

    Inwardly, I suspect, Oromis is a kind dwarf. Younger than most dwarves I've met, Oromis is seemingly eager to help his friends and please his master. He works for Exatorus, though I note he is significantly underpaid for his work. Oromis doesn't say much. I asked him why and he responded, <q>I let my axe do the talking.</q>

    Oromis doesn't say much about his past. Here's what I have gathered: there aren't many other dwarves in the region, so he is an immigrant. He is unlearned, so he uses his weapons as hired muscle. He is employed and has found purpose, so I do not believe he will ever question his life. So long as he can keep mead in his cup, he seems outwardly happy. But when he is not happy, my constructed emotions tell me to fear him lest I find myself in the path of his rage.
