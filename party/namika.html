       Namika is a scholar at heart, constantly buried in scrolls and books. She has been wanting to study Sheikah history above all other subjects, but finds herself unable to advance her knowledge in Hyrule because most relics have already been unearthed and studied. She hears rumors that Calatia may have been visited by ancient Sheikah and may have other relics or treasures to encounter. Though she is a scholar, she is proficient in her long bow and is very capable of defending herself and those around her from any threat.

<h2>Biography</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Sailing to Calatia</dt>
    <dd>
        Namika arrived in Malin Harbor, intent on traveling to Calatia to continue her studies into Sheikah history. In the harbor, she met <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/zedeki">Zedeki</a> and soon signed her contract with <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#miko">Captain Miko</a> to be a mercenary on Nayru's Blessing. She joined Zedeki's day crew. During the night of the attack, she kept herself hidden in the shadows and fired arrows at the <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#masked-assailants">Captain Miko</a>. She joined the rest of the day crew as they escaped on the life boat while Miko destroyed the ship. Before she left, Miko gave her a bag with a single bomb in it.

    <dt>The Southern Lighthouse</dt>
    <dd>
        Namika and the others exhausted themselves rowing to shore. In the distance, she could see <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-lore#lighthouses">The Southern Lighthouse</a>. The party decided to head there in the morning after they had rested. When they arrived, they found it occupied by Bokoblins. Namika and Zedeki together shot at the Bokoblins while <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/ophinia">Ophinia</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/gongu">Gongu</a> distracted them. After the battle, Namika met with <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#tarin">Tarin</a> and learned that the light stone that powered the lighthouse was actually a <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-lore#sheikah">Sheikah</a> relic, though Tarin could only identify it as some blessing from the <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-lore#caretaker">Caretaker</a>. She offered to help Tarin dispose of the Bokoblin bodies.
