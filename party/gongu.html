        Small for a Goron, Gongu is an enigma amongst his brothers. He cares little for hammers and smashing weapons, preferring his long bow. Gongu spent much of his childhood roaming and adventuring on his own. He spends much of his time with his wolf companion, <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/whisper">Whisper</a>, a strange beast that never seems to make any noise. Gongu has learned the ability to speak with his companion, a gift from the goddess Hylia. They travel to Calatia to "find meaning." Not surprising for a Goron, Gongu cannot swim and has a fear of water.
