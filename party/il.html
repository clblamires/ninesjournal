    Most fairies produce a soft white or pink glow. Il, unfortunately, emits a darkish purple glow that gets stronger depending on his mood. Il suffers from depression for some reason and is almost constantly bringing down the mood of everyone around him. Il is bound by duty to Captain Miko of Nayru's Blessing, but very clearly does not enjoy his service. He often annoys his comrades, such that Zedeki occasionally banishes him when provoked too far.
