<h2>Red's Companions</h2>


<p>
    Red travels the world, seeking for a way to return the Heart of Valtare to the hidden temple in Missuk. Along the way, he makes friends that join him as companions in his quest.

<h4>Corlee</h4>

    <li><b>Race</b>: Halfling</li>
    <li><b>Class</b>: Monk</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Corlee says she hails from a monastery somewhere in Idil and that she and her master have been traveling so that Corlee can accomplish some important feat during a pilgrimage. She does not know much about this pilgrimage, however, and ended up getting lost between Noname and Fort Trine in the country of Solsu. She regularly visited a family of roadside merchants, wrestling with them for room and food. Eventually, Corlee met with Red while watching him struggle to catch fish. She offered to accompany him, assisting with the takedown of a cultist tower just off the main road towards Idil.
