<h1>Whisper</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Race:</strong> Wolf
    <br>
    <strong>Weapons:</strong> Fangs
</p>

<p>
    Whisper is a strange creature. He is a wolf with strong jaws, long gray fur, and incredible strength. Despite this, the wolf makes absolutely no sound when it moves, breaths, or tracks. This causes those around Whisper to feel very intimidated, but Whisper's companion, <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/gongu">Gongu</a>, feels safe around him. Gongu and Whisper share a powerful bond, having saved each other many times. Gongu is even able to communicate with Whisper through the use of magic, and Whisper refuses to speak to anyone else.

    <dt>Sailing to Calatia</dt>
    <dd>
        Gongu and Whisper had been traveling away from Eldin and Goron City, and came to Malin Harbor. <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/il">Il</a> spotted him from afar, having been told to find strong warriors to protect the merchant ship Nayru's Blessing. <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/zedeki">Zedeki</a> spoke with Gongu and offered him a job as a mercenary on the ship, and the two were hired by <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-people#miko">Captain Miko</a> on the condition that Gongu cleans up after Whisper. Whisper spent the journey helping keep the rat population on the ship under control. During the attack on the ship, Whisper assisted <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/ophinia">Ophinia</a> in close combat while Gongu assisted from behind. Whisper escaped the ship with the rest of the group as Miko destroyed it to stop the attackers.

    <dd>
        During the skirmish at <a href="{{ site.url }}/calatia-lore#lighthouses">The Southern Lighthouse</a>, Whisper quickly made himself an asset to the team, sneaking behind the burned ruins of the barn and mauling the Bokoblins that tried to sneak up on Zedeki and <a href="{{ site.url }}/party/namika">Namika</a>. At Gongu's command, Whisper spent the day sniffing for more Bokoblins just in case any others were coming to the lighthouse.
