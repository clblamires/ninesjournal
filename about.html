<p>
    My name is <a href="https://clblamires.github.io">Casey</a> and I'm a professor of web development. This site, Number Nine's Blog, was built for my Dungeons and Dragons group. The seven of us (six plus the <abbr>DM</abbr>) all have busy lives, but we try to get together at least once or twice a month to play. None of us have much experience, except for Luna and the <abbr>DM</abbr>.
</p>
<p>
    This website was built with HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS, Jekyll, Github, and Netlify. The design of the page is all my own, with some Font Awesome thrown in.
</p>
<p>
    I teach Web Design, Computer Programming, and App Development at Lewis-Clark State College. I built this site to see if I could make an entire site in half an hour. It's not perfect, but it's functional. My students and I often take on simple projects for experience and portfolio-building, and our rates are reasonable. Let me know if you have questions!
