<p>
    The gods of this world all sing the praises of He That Rolls the Dice of Fate. Little is known about this entity. He has no worshippers because none know his face. No sacrifices are made to him, though the occasional prayer is made to him when fate is not on our side. But the Dungeon Master does not heed our cries of mercy. Does he even truly exist? The world may never know.
