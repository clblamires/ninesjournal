The spiders were dead, but we were uneasy. Ezio and I inspected the barn and found it devastated. Hebo, Oromis, Petra, and Luna went to the farmhouse and found it the same. But there was a problem: the farmer was missing. Ezio noticed strange tracks on the ground and wondered if Hebo wasn't telling us something important about the farmer. Hebo insisted that the farmer was good and something very dreadful happened here while he was away. Ezio and Luna watched over our group while we rested. During the night, Ezio extracted venom from one of the dead spiders. 

In the morning, Hebo wanted to follow the the tracks to find the farmer. Oromis wanted to take a spider carcass to his master. We convinced Hebo to join us instead of following the tracks. Exatorus, we explained, may have answers for us. We soon discovered the strength of dwarves far outmatches any of our own as Oromis lifted the spider's body onto a wagon and began pushing it by himself towards Exatorus's home in the hills. Hebo gathered some food for the group and we followed Oromis.

Along the way, Oromis began to grow tired. Ezio and I tried to help but we could not get the cart to budge more than a few inches. Frustrated, Ezio went into the woods to hunt. He had been gone a long time, and Luna and Hebo went after him. Oromis and Petra remained behind with me. More time passed and the three of us began to worry that our comrades were in trouble. We ventured only a few hundred feet into the nearby woods before we saw Hebo, Luna, and a bleeding Ezio emerge. Luna described the situation:

Ezio found tracks in the woods and began to follow them. While travelling, he happened upon Hebo and Luna who had apparently been looking for Ezio but had gotten lost. They were not as sneaky as Ezio, as it turns out, and had attracted the attention of an Auroch. The auroch attacked and left Ezio with a serious would in his side. Luna jumped in front of the Auroch and began speaking to it, using some Druidish spell to calm it while Hebo tended to Ezio's wound. The three of them escaped while the Auroch stamped around in anger.

The party was reassembled at the cart and saw that vultures had been pecking at the spider's body. Angry (perhaps only at himself), Ezio drew his bow and loosed an arrow at the birds. One was grazed by the arrow, and they all flew away. Ezio's hunt was a failure. Oromis felt well-rested enough to keep pushing, though at a noticeably slower pace. We eventually ended up at his master's home again. Exatorus was agast at the sight of the phase spider and commended us in bringing its body for study. He offered to pay each of us for the work and we readily accepted.

Exatorus told us nothing about the new larger creature that attacked Hebo's farm. At least, nothing we didn't know. We knew it was large and it carried some heavy weapon like a club or greatsword. But Exatorus gave us the same charge as he did with the original attackers: bring it to him, preferably alive.

Oromis was again sent with us on the mission, but he refused to push the cart by himself. Petra suggested we purchase a horse by pooling our gold pieces together. Ezio, unfortunately and not uncharacteristically, refused. Hebo had the mind to offer to pay Ezio to stay with us to help find the farmer. So Ezio purchased his own riding horse while the rest of us purchased a horse for the cart. While at the stables, the stablemaster offered us money if we could bring him some iron ore from the mountains. While my comrades purchased horses, I found a shop operated by a very fat halfling. I purchased more lengths of rope. If we are going to capture a creature, we should be prepared to bind it.

We each spent the night in our own ways. Hebo sang at the local inn for room and food, and he, Luna, and Petra spent the night there. Oromis returned to his master's home as he had a room there. I don't know where Ezio went. I spent the night in the alley outside the inn. People don't like my kind, but I don't mind it. It's easier for everyone if I stay out of the affairs of the commonfolk.
