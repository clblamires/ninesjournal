    Petra is much shorter than me, so I often miss her as I move. Petra is in a class of her own as a combatant, able to quickly work powerful spells to take control of the battlefield and leave her enemies as mere piles of ash. I have seen creatures of darkness dismiss her as a tiny morsel, then fall prey to her summons of fire and ice. Her dragonblood has given her strange physical features. Half of her face is dragon-like, covered in dark scales with a large, reptilian eye.

<p>
    Despite this, she is one of the most peaceful members of our party. None of us are alike in any way, and logic dictates that none of us should travel together. And yet, here we are. Petra, for her own part, leaves a cheery air around her, even causing Ezio to occasionally smile. She will not make me smile, though. I do not have lips.

<p>
    I do not know much else about Petra. I do not know where Petra comes from, or where she is going. Like Luna, she seems to be subject to her own whims and desires. Her attitude is somewhat chaotic. She was the first of us to meet Hebo and agree to help him. If not for Petra, I fear our party would be very disadvantaged.
