<h1>Lore and Information of Calatia</h1>

<p>
    Calatia is a vast country, larger than most others in the world. It sits to the far north of Hyrule and the surrounding areas. Rumor has it that the Hero of Time was resurrected here, and that he may be born here again soon...

    <dt id="provinces">Provinces</dt>
    <dd>
        The story has only recently begun, and we've seen only one province: Loftwing Province, named for the Loftwing birds that reside in its high places. Its capital is Skygarden, a city high atop the Toronbo Mountains. The city is known for its Loftwing breeders, but has a reputation for being unwelcome to newcomers.
        <br>
        Mabel Village is to the far west. It is a fishing village that borders a forest simply called The Mysterious Woods.
        <br>
        Oldtown is at the province's eastern border. It is a very poor town run by the Church of the Caretaker.

    <dt id="old_calatia">Old Calatia</dt>
    <dd>
        Tarin, caretaker of the Southern Lighthouse, mentioned this region of the country to the far north. This was the original country of Calatia before some awful cataclysm laid it to waste. Few people venture to Old Calatia now, and its ruins are buried in more and more snow each year.
    </dd>

    <dt id="caretaker">The Caretaker</dt>
    <dd>The Hyruleans have many stories and legends of the gods that created their world. The Calatians do, too, but revere one above all others: the God of Protection, also called The Caretaker. The Caretaker is usually depicted as a tall figure  wearing thick furs and a long hood. The Church of the Caretaker is the primary religion in Calatia.</dd>

    <dt id="hylia">Hylia</dt>
    <dd>Hylia is honored as the guardian and protector of Hyrule. But in Calatia, she is largely unknown. A small and dirty shrine to her is found in a back alley of Mabel Village's fishing district.</dd>

    <dt id="lighthouses">Lighthouses</dt>
    <dd>Large, magical lighthouses guard the borders of Calatia and are revered as holy sites to worshippers of the Caretaker. There are three lighthouses in use: The Southern Lighthouse in the Loftwing Province, the Western Lighthouse on the Western Sea, and the Eastern Lighthouse bordering the icy bay. A fourth lighthouse is rumored to be in Old Calatia, but has long since been lost to history. The legend says that the Lighthouses are meant to keep the darkness at bay, but few people understand what that means or if this is even their true purpose.</dd>

    <dt id="sheikah">Sheikah</dt>
    <dd>The Sheikah were the original surveyors and explorers in the world, and are most commonly seen in Hyrule. Sheikah-made relics and items have also been found in Calatia. In fact, the magic stone that gives power to the Southern Lighthouse has the symbol of the Sheikah engraved on it: a lidless eye with a tear of blood. What connection to the ancient Sheikah have with Calatia?</dd>

    <dt id="spring-of-wellness">Spring of Wellness</dt>
    <dd>
        This is a magical spring in the Featherwood Forest. Those that bathe in it are granted instant relief to their pains and abounding energy. A purple Bokoblin, Huk, currently operates the spring as a campground and charges a small fee to bathe. He enchanted the spring so that it dyes a swimmer's skin purple for a few days while also giving them a boost of energy.

    <dt id="tailcave">Tail Cave</dt>
    <dd>
        Tail Cave is a small cave south of Mabel Village, and has been shut to the public for a very long time by Ulrira, the Elder of Mabel Village. It was originally a fishing location during high tides, but was most recently used as a site for the masked people to abduct Leera and Adria. A Mothula had grown large in the cave, feeding on crabs or fish.
    </dd>

    <dt id="downrigger">Downrigger</dt>
    <dd>
        A title given to the head of the local police force in Mabel Village. In fishing terms, a downrigger keeps a line below water while trolling for food. In police terms, the Downrigger "keeps the darkness below the surface". Other towns have local police forces as well, but only Mabel Village uses the term Downrigger.
    </dd>

    <dt id="marshals">Marshals</dt>
    <dd>
        The Marshals are the provincial police force, moving between towns and cities in a province. 
    </dd>

    <dt id="sentinels">Sentinels</dt>
    <dd>
        The Sentinels are the kingdom's roaming police force. They are not tied to any specific location, instead moving from town to town working dangerous jobs for the people they meet. Their salary (1000 rupees per month) is subsidized by the Crown of Calatia. No sentinel has come to the Loftwing Province in many years.
    </dd>

    <dt id="crazytracy">Crazy Tracy's Potion Shop</dt>
    <dd>
        This is a chain of potion shops all around Calatia, usually run by Gerudo potion makers. Their potions are priced extraordinarily high but are incredibly useful. They offer discounts to patrons who bring their own ingredients. The potion shop also occasionally sells discount potions and a "mystery potion" in a small black bottle.
