    We don't know much about Luna. I suspect Luna doesn't know much about Luna. She's a powerful spell-weaver and talented in close combat, but her happy-go-lucky attitude leaves me wondering: Who does she serve? What is she hiding? What is the source of that constant ringing noise she summons that causes her enemies to cringe and die?
</p>
<p>
    That said, I personally am not afraid of her. She has been nothing but outwardly friendly to the party. And what should I fear? She agrees to everything Hebo and Petra tell her. None of us (Luna included) know why she was in these parts of the world right now. She follows her heart.  I am at peace with her as a comrade, but I do not understand her.

    I guess I should feel some connection with her since she saved me from the Kraul during an unfortunate encounter. She teleported me away from my attacker and gave me an opening to remove its limbs from its body.
