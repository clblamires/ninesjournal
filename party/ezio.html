    At first, I didn't trust Ezio. No one did. He's a rogue, after all. He generally keeps his face hidden from us, his comrades. And I am fairly certain he keeps a knife tucked away in each of his boots. Ezio worked for a thief guild years ago, but has been adventuring with our strange group for the past few weeks. When we came from Exatorus's home, he was in a daze. I suspect the dragonborn cast some magic on him.

    Regardless, Ezio is evidently loyal to our party and we should be happy to have him around. He is knowledgeable of the world around him. He is impulsive, perhaps to a fault, but his skills with a longbow have been very useful. He is a master of the sleight of hand, trickery, and shadows. We should thank the gods that he has been working with us instead of against us.
