    I honestly do not know what we are doing in this world right now. What is our purpose? What is my purpose? I suppose it does not matter as long as we are alive. This is a list of our current tasks and the things we need to do to make them happen, as far as we understand it.

        <p>
            Ezio saw a Simurgh while he watched over our camp, and has a rainbow feather to prove it. Exatorus seemed particularly interested in finding and studying the creature, especially since it is not only a rare sight, but also unexpectedly far away from desert regions.

            The farmer is missing and likely has been taken by whatever giant creature ran through the farm. We offered to help Hebo find and rescue his friend. The farmer is safe now, and we'll escort him back into town.

        <p>
            Something attacked Hebo's farm, and Exatorus wants us to find it. He prefers that we bring it back to him alive, but that might not be possible. We found it underneath the plains surrounded by Kraul.

        <h3>Bring It to Me Alive</h3>
        <p>
            Exatorus wanted it alive. We couldn't guarantee it would survive if we found it. And it didn't. I ended up overkilling it by blowing its head off. We scavanged its legs to provide the wizard with a sample, but the rest of the body of the drow spider will rot in the tunnels below the sun.

        <h3>Capturing Monsters</h3>
        <p>
            Exatorus wanted a sample of the monster or monsters that attacked Hebo's farm. As it turned out, these were phase spiders. Oromis, being the brute that he is, lifted and hauled the spider's dead body to Exatorus himself.

        <p>
            Phase spiders had been attacking Hebo's farm, and he asked us to join him in defending it. We successfully killed the monsters, but not before they killed the animals and wrecked both the barn and the farmhouse.

        <p>
            The stablemaster who sold Ezio the horse asked us to find him some iron ore while we were in the mountains. I have some smithing tools with me for this kind of job.

        <p>
            Ezio really wanted a horse, and Oromis wasn't complaining after hauling the cart up to Exatoris all by himself. Our party ended up with two horses and I almost immediately forgot their names.
