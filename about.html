<h1>About this Site</h1>

<p>
    My name is <a href="https://clblamires.github.io">Casey</a> and I'm a professor of web development and computer science. This site, Number Nine's Journal, was built for my Dungeons and Dragons group. Each of the players all have very busy lives but we try to get together as often as we can to play. 
</p>
<p>
    This website was built with HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 4, and is powered by Jekyll and Netlify. The design of the page is all my own, with some Font Awesome thrown in.
</p>
<p>
    I teach Web Design, Computer Programming, and App Development. The original version of this site was made to see if I could make an entire site in half an hour. It's not perfect, but it's functional. My students and I often take on simple projects for experience and portfolio-building, and our rates are reasonable. Let me know if you have questions!
